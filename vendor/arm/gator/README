This repository contains ARM DS-5 Streamline's components for profiling. Build produces two artifacts, gatord and gator.ko and they are only included in debug variants.

Update procedure
----------------
Delete gator-daemon and gator-driver directories.
Unpack new ones from DS-5 delivery into repository.
Bring back gator-driver/Kbuild file (it should be same as Makefile).
Bring back gator-driver/Android.mk
Make sure gator-daemon/Android.mk's LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS is set to debug.
Build both driver and daemon with mm command to verify it builds.
Deliver.
Pray you didn't brake any other product build since all gator gits are pointing to master, except frozen ones (it should be ok).
